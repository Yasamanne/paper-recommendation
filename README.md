# paper-recommendation
 Summary:
 - Exponential growth in data availability of data => it impossible for a normal human being to mine it  
 - Recommender systems alleviate the difficulties related to Big Data and optimize recurrent tasks: filter and present relevant information to make an efficient decision 
 - 1.8 million papers published every year in over 25,000 journals 
 - To simplify the literature review process, recommendation systems connect relevant research papers using citations
 - The recommendation system would be based on the abstract, or other relevant text in the papers â‡’ Abstracts efficiently summarize the context of the paper and provide a clear idea about the direction of the research. 
 - Building a robust paper recommendation system with a context-based approach:
     1. Increases the speed of project completion
     2. Benefits the research community and society as a whole
     3. As well as STEM students since the dataset used is focused on scientific papers
